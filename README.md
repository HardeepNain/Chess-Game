# Chess-Game
A dynamic web-based Chess game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project implements all standard chess rules — including castling, pawn promotion, en passant, and checkmate detection. The interface allows piece movement via click or drag, displays captured pieces, and provides undo, restart, and top-view controls.
